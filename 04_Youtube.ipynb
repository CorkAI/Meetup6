If kept unchecked capitalism will have your children working in a factory from dusk till dawn for less than a meal ticket. Things like minimum wage and limited working hours are socialist policies. Taxes and such are important to implement these policies. \\n2) People say that capitalism creates incentive to create and innovate. This is not the result of capitalism. It's a consequence of competition. We are fortunate that competition exists (which has been around since life started). Capitalism does not like competition. As a capitalist, your business will be running at is most optimal when you have a monopoly. The only reason to innovate when you have a monopoly is to fend off competition.\\n3) Capitalism thrives on screwing people over. To make a gain, someone else has to take an L. This is why companies shift their production sites to some other country where they can exploit the people there and make larger profits. (Because capitalism serves profit. Not the people)\\n\\nMy personal problem with capitalism is that it does not put goods and services into the hands of people who need it. It puts goods and services into the hands of those who can pay for them. (Because capitalism does not serve the people)\\nBut you're going to disagree with me, anyways. Lol. Most people do.\",\n",

If kept unchecked capitalism will have your children working in a factory from dusk till dawn for less than a meal ticket. Things like minimum wage and limited working hours are socialist policies.

It's a consequence of competition. We are fortunate that competition exists (which has been around since life started). Capitalism does not like competition. As a capitalist, your business will be running at is most optimal when you have a monopoly. The only reason to innovate when you have a monopoly is to fend off competition.\\n3) Capitalism thrives on screwing people over. To make a gain, someone else has to take an L. This is why companies shift their production sites to some other country where they can exploit the people there and make larger profits. (Because capitalism serves profit.
